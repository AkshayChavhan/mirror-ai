# Learning docs rule (always follow)

This project is for learning. Every step we take gets written up in `docs/learning/`.

- **File names:** two-digit number, underscore, snake_case topic, `.md`. For example `01_installation_setup.md` and `02_prisma_setup.md`. Pick the next unused number, and don't renumber existing files.
- **Every command goes in the doc, even small ones like `cd mirror-ai`.** Show each one in a code block. Under it, add a one-line **Why:** saying what it does and why we run it.
- **Keep it short, but complete.** Use bullets, not paragraphs. Skip filler, but don't leave out any step, flag, env var, or file needed to reproduce the work.
- Include the config and code changes we made, plus any gotchas we hit (errors, version pins, workarounds) and how we fixed them.
- Update the matching learning doc in the same turn as the work. Don't leave it for later.
